<h1>Trigger Tracker</h1>
<span>
<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p>Although this is still a work in progress, this trigger tracker will allow users to track every day activities to see if there is a trend that may be influencing and/or triggering their ailment, such as too much caffeine triggering a migraine or too little sleep triggering an epileptic seizure.  It will be combined with the Trigger Tracker Diary once completed, which you can find within my repositories and will be linked shortly.</p>
<p>I have used HTML, CSS, JS, Node, Express, and MongoDB to create this fullstack app.  It is currently hosted on Heroku, but as that will no longer be available for free beginning in November, that will soon be changed.</p>
<p>The current-most project is making a user friendly interface and connecting the two apps (this and the diary mentioned above) together.</p>
